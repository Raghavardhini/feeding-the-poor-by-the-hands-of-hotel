The project is entitled as “FEEDING THE POOR BY THE HAND OF HOTELS”.
The Project Entitled as “FOOD WASTAGE REDUCTION THROUGH DONATION APPLICATION” is a study of cross platform mobile application, developed to prevent food insecurity, a lack of access to healthy and affordable food.
The donor can be either individual, or from hotels and function halls. 
The donation recipient can be either from orphanages, old homes, shelters, etc. 
The purpose of this application is to connect the users without any intermediary service. 
The focus of the project is to develop an android application that uses data analysis to visualize the impact of excess food, thus reducing food wastage. 
People donate food manually by visiting each organization number of times so as to scale back the issues of food wastage where as there are websites that have taken efforts to help people donate food.
It shows the potential for avoiding the wastage of food.
The users need to register into the application and can offer or request for donation. 
The notification will be sent to the other and they can either accept or deny the service given. 
This can be tracked by the participants to ensure the food delivery.
This way the app helps the needy and averts food wastage and hunger.
